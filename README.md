#My First Mejor Project
Thrilled to share my journey of building a complete web application from scratch, combining front-end and back-end skills to create a dynamic, full-stack experience. This project has been a game-changer in my learning journey, helping me understand the full cycle of web development and expanding my skills in:

🛠 Frontend: Built with HTML, EJS, CSS, and Bootstrap for responsive and interactive user interfaces.

⚙️ Backend: Developed using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB for reliable database management.

🔍 Key Concepts: Understanding server mechanics, HTTP requests (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE), middleware, sessions, cookies, and custom error handling.

🔒 Security: Implemented robust authentication, password hashing with salt, and authorization features.

💡 Database & Architecture: Created schemas, modeled relationships, and explored MVC, file uploads (Cloudinary, Multer), and geocoding features for dynamic mapping.

🌐 Advanced Features: Integrated flash messaging, validation, and environment management with dotenv for smooth deployment.
